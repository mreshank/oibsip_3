# This is a small and simple project “ATM Machine”.

This is a console-based application to demonstrate the working of a common ATM we use in our day to day life. 

> When the system starts the user is prompted with user id and user pin. 

> On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. 

The project allows to perform following operations:

> Transactions History

> Withdraw

> Deposit

> Transfer

> Quit
